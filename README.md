# Fashion-Recommendation-System-using-Image-Features
This project is a "Fashion Recommendation System" that suggests similar items based on an uploaded image. 
Built with  "TensorFlow: and "Streamlit", it leverages "ResNet50" for feature extraction and "Nearest Neighbors" for similarity search. 
The web application includes options to add favorite items and view them in a favorites section.

#Project Overview
The Fashion Recommendation System helps users find visually similar items in a fashion catalog by uploading an image of an item. 
The backend feature extraction model, based on "ResNet50", transforms images into feature vectors, which are then compared using "Nearest Neighbors" for similar image retrieval.
